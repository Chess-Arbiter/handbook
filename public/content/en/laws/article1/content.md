Article 1: The nature and objectives of the game of chess
=========================================================

**1.1** The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces on a square board called a chessboard.

**1.2** The player with the light-coloured pieces (White) makes the first move, then the players move alternately, with the player with the dark-coloured pieces (Black) making the next move.

**1.3** A player is said to have the move when his opponents move has been made.

**1.4** The objective of each player is to place the opponents king under attack in such a way that the opponent has no legal move.

**1.4.1** The player who achieves this goal is said to have checkmated the opponents king and to have won the game. Leaving ones own king under attack, exposing ones own king to attack and also capturing the opponents king is not allowed .

**1.4.2** The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.

**1.5** If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate the opponents king, the game is drawn (see. [Article 5.2.2](./article5)).
