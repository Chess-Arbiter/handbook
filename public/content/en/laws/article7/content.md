# Article 7: Irregularities

**7.1** If an irregularity occurs and the pieces have to be restored to a previous position, the arbiter shall use his best judgement to determine the times to be shown on the chessclock. This includes the right not to change the clock times. He shall also, if necessary, adjust the clock’s move-counter.

**7.2.1** If during a game it is found that the initial position of the pieces was incorrect, the game shall be cancelled and a new game shall be played.

**7.2.2** If during a game it is found that the chessboard has been placed contrary to [Article 2.1](./article2), the game shall continue but the position reached must be transferred to a correctly placed chessboard.

**7.3** If a game has started with colours reversed then, if less than 10 moves have been made by both players, it shall be discontinued and a new game played with the correct colours. After 10 moves or more, the game shall continue .

**7.4.1** If a player displaces one or more pieces, he shall re-establish the correct position in his own time.

**7.4.2** If necessary, either the player or his opponent shall stop the chessclock and ask for the arbiter’s assistance.

**7.4.3** The arbiter may penalise the player who displaced the pieces.

**7.5.1** An illegal move is completed once the player has pressed his clock. If during a game it is found that an illegal move has been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. [Article 4.3](./article4) and [4.7](./article4) apply to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position.

**7.5.2** If the player has moved a pawn to the furthest distant rank, pressed the clock, but not replaced the pawn with a new piece, the move is illegal. The pawn shall be replaced by a queen of the same colour as the pawn.

**7.5.3** If the player presses the clock without making a move, it shall be considered and penalized as if an illegal move.

**7.5.4** If a player uses two hands to make a single move (for example in case of castling, capturing or promotion) and pressed the clock, it shall be considered and penalized as if an illegal move.

**7.5.5** After the action taken under Article 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.3 or 7.5.4 for the first completed illegal move by a player, the arbiter shall give two minutes extra time to his opponent; for the second completed illegal move by the same player the arbiter shall declare the game lost by this player. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.

**7.6** If, during a game it is found that any piece has been displaced from its correct square, the position before the irregularity shall be reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position.
