# The Scheveningen system

**The Scheveningen system** is a system of chess tournaments where each member of one team plays with all the members of the other one.

## Holding procedure

The Scheveningen system is used as in individual point counting, but also in team point counting tournaments. Moreover, **all the participants of one team play only against the other team participants, not playing against each other.** The order and colors of the competitors' games are determined by lot according to the table. For instance, let us study the example of Scheveningen system tournament between A and B teams. Team members have a regular number: team A- I - VI, team B - 1 - 6. In the first round, the lot determines which team will play with the white pieces. The players with the same regular number meet. In second round, Team A plays with the blacks. The numbers change the competitors: N1 plays against N2, N VI with N 1. In the third round the colors are changed again and the numbers change the competitors again and so on. (see the table below).

| 1 round | 2 round | 3 round | 4 round | 5 round | 6 round |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| А - В   | А - В   | А - В   | А - В   | А - В   | А - В   |
| I - 1   | I - 2   | I - 3   | I - 4   | I - 5   | I - 6   |
| II - 2  | II - 3  | II - 4  | II - 5  | II - 6  | II - 1  |
| III - 3 | III - 4 | III - 5 | III - 6 | III - 1 | III - 2 |
| IV - 4  | IV - 5  | IV - 6  | IV - 1  | IV - 2  | IV - 3  |
| V - 5   | V - 6   | V - 1   | V - 2   | V - 3   | V - 4   |
| VI - 6  | VI - 1  | VI - 2  | VI - 3  | VI - 4  | VI - 5  |
