# Sonneborn–Berger score

**The Sonneborn–Berger** score (or the Neustadtl score) is a scoring system often used to break ties in chess tournaments. It is **computed by summing the conventional score of each defeated opponent, and half the conventional score of each drawn opponent.** The main point is to give more value for a win/draw against a player ranked high, than for a win/draw against a player ranked low in the tournament. Since players may share the same Neustadtl score, further means of breaking ties may be required; common methods include considering the score in games played between the tied players or favouring the player with the most wins. Neustadtl remains the most common tie-breaking method in [round-robin](./round_system) tournaments, though in case of nessecity it is used in other types of tournaments, where the players, who should be distributed, have played equal number of games.
