# Round robin

**Round robin** is a system where each participant of the tournament plays with all the other participants. It is considered the fairest system, but requires more games.

## Holding procedure

- The order of the games among the competitors in the circular system is not essential. The participants of the competing pairs in the ordinal round are determined by lot. Each participant is given a serial number. The number of participants is assigned N, **if the number is even**, then N=2K. Participants, whose personal numbers are written against each other, play in the first round. To create a similar table for subsequent rounds, the number 1 is left in place and the other numbers are moved clockwise. **If the number of participants is odd**, a zero is added, and the above mentioned steps are performed for already even number of participants. The participant, who receives a 0 in front of his/ her number, stays free and does not play in that game.
- In the case of the round robin, the number of meetings is calculated by the following formula: **N(N-1) / 2**, where N is the number of teams (players).
- The number of games is equal to N-1 for even number of participants and N for odd number of participants (each participant misses one game as he doesn't have a competitor).
- As a result of each game the players receive several points. For instance, in chess it is 1 point for a win, 0 for a defeat and 0.5 for a draw. The points earned during the tournament are added up and the places are distributed according to the sum of the points.
- If two or more participants earn an equal number of points, additional indexes are used for their classification: [Berger coefficient](./berger), direct encounter and other indicators, which will be confirmed in the tournament regulation. If the competitors’ all the indicators are equal, the rules offer the participants an opportunity of playing additional games or “Sharing of the places “, that is when the participants with equal number of points are considered to take two or more places.
