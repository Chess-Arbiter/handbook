# Match

**Match** is one of the types of chess tournaments. It is a competition between two competitors or teams.

The match **between the two competitors** is made up of a predetermined number of games (e.g. 12, 16 or 24). Rarely, the match is being held until a certain number of wins (e.g. up to 6, 8 or 10).

**In Team Access**, participants in a team are distributed in a certain order (chessboards) according to their qualifications. Each match is played by participants facing the same board (for example, one team's third board plays against the other team's third board).
