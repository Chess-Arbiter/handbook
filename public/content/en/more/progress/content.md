# Progress

**Progress** is the sum of the total points collected after each round.

**For example**, N participant played in a Swiss system tournament consisting of 7 rounds as follows: 1, 0, 0.5, 1, 1, 0, 1. In this case, he had 1 point after the first round, 1 point after the second round, 1.5 points after the third round, 2.5 points after the fourth round, 3.5 points after the fifth round, 3.5 points after the sixth round, 4.5 points after the seventh round. Sum all those numbers; 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 4.5 = 17.5. This's called Progress.

The idea is that the better the player has started, the higher coefficient of the participant will be. And better started players, as a rule, play with stronger opponents.
