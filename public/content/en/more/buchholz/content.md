# Buchholz system

This indicator is used when two or more participants earn equal points. The player with a higher Buchholz coefficient is ranked higher in the tournament. The Buchholz coefficient of this participant **is the sum of the points earned by all the competitors of that participant, regardless of the result of the game.** The idea is that the participant who played with stronger competitors (competitors who have earned more points) has a higher place. All non-playing games (+/-) are conditionally considered ended in a draw.

If two and more participants are equal both in the number of the points scored, and in the Buchholz coefficient, **the least-scored competitor's points are subtracted from each player's Buchholz coefficient.** If after this operation the coefficients of the Buchholz remain equal (without the competitor earning the least amount of points), then the process continues, subtracting the next lowest competitor's points and so on.

The following types of Buchholz are also used:

- **The Median-Buchholz 1** is the Buchholz reduced by the highest and the lowest scores of the opponents.
- **The Median Buchholz 2** is the Buchholz score reduced by the two highest and the two lowest scores of the opponents.
- **The Buchholz Cut 1** is the Buchholz score reduced by the lowest score of the opponents.
- **The Buchholz Cut 2** is the Buchholz score reduced by the two lowest scores of the opponents
- **Sum of Buhgoltz** - Sum of Competitors' Buhgoltz Indicators.
